<p><font size="5" face="Arial Black">How do I save and load
games?</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Arial">CompuChess saves games in a format
known as PGN which stands for portable game notation, this format
is recognised by nearly every major chess program on the market
and there are thousands of games on the Internet for download
which use this standard.</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Arial">If you want to save you current
game then press Ctrl + S, or go to: </font><font color="#004080"
size="3" face="Arial"><em>'File | Save'</em></font><font size="3"
face="Arial"> , this will bring up a dialog box which will enable
you to write information to go with the game moves. You can
include the players names, the site, the round etc, this is all
standard data included in PGN files although it isnt necessary to
enter any of the data.</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Arial">If you want to load a game then
press Ctrl + O or go to: </font><font color="#004080" size="3"
face="Arial"><em>'File | Open'</em></font><font size="3"
face="Arial"> , this will allow you to open any PGN file. Note
that opening a game will erase any game you are currently playing
so you might want to save first. After you load a game a dialog
box will appear filled with information contained within the
file, this data includes the players names, the date, the site,
the round and the result of the game.<br>
If there is more than one game contained within the PGN file a
dialog box will appear listing all the games, you can then click
on one and press OK to open it. At this point you can also access
the 'next game', 'previous game' and 'select a game' functions on
the 'Action' menu to browse the current PGN file.<br>
Once you have loaded a PGN file you can use the 'Go fowards 1
move' and 'Go backwards 1 move' functions to navigate through the
file, </font><a href="navigate.html"><font size="3" face="Arial">click
here for more information on this.</font></a></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Arial">You can also save and load position files which 
  have the FEN (Forsythe-Edwards notation) extension, these files contain no header 
  information and only one position which automatically loads. To save and load 
  FEN files use the same method as PGN files but give them a FEN extension, like 
  &quot;example.fen&quot;.</font></p>
