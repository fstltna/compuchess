<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 'Computer Play Options' dialog 
  gives you the chance to configure the computer player and the type of game you 
  wish to play. <strong>Note that this will have a large impact on the strength 
  at which CompuChess plays.</strong></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There are 4 types of game you can 
  play:</font></p>
<ul>
  <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Ply depth-</strong> In 
    this type of game the computer searches for a specified number of half-moves 
    (plies). For example in a 2-ply search CompuChess will consider all the moves 
    it can make and then all the possible replies to those moves. CompuChess can 
    search up to 40 plies- although the larger the value the longer the search 
    takes to complete.<br>
    This type of game is recommended for beginners, as CompuChess set with a Ply 
    search of 1 can be a very weak opponent.</font></li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Timer per Move-</strong> 
    You specify, in seconds how much time CompuChess spends thinking about a move. 
    After CompuChess has thought for the amount of time specified it will make 
    it's best move.</font></li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Total time + increment- 
    </strong>This type of game is more like a tournament, each player has a set 
    amount of time in which to play all of thier moves, if the increment value 
    is set higher than 0 then you will have that amount of time added to your 
    clock after every move. For example if you have a total time of 30 mins and 
    and increment of 10 seconds then each player would get 30 minutes to make 
    all of their moves but after each move they would get an extra 10 seconds 
    added to thier total time.<br>
    With this game the chess clock at the bottom of the screen will begin the 
    game displaying the total time remaining and count down until it reaches 0, 
    at this point the player who runs out of time loses the game.</font></li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Championship- </strong>This 
    time both players have a certain amount of time to complete a set amount of 
    moves, if they fail to complete the moves in the time allowed then they lose 
    the game. The chess clock at the bottom of the screen will also begin displaying 
    the remaining time and count down to 0.<br>
    If a player manages to complete all the moves in the time limit then the 'extenended 
    search limits' are used, this is another dialog box in itself accessible when 
    you select a Championship game.<br>
    <br>
    The extended search limits allow you to play the remaining game either in 
    a set amount of time- like in the 'total time' game above (but without the 
    increment), or in another championship game where both players have to complete 
    another set of moves in another time limit.</font></li>
